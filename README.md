**Given Scenario with Ultra SPARCIO Workstation:**
- **Reference Computer:**
  - Ultra SPARCIO workstation with a 300 MHz Ultra SPARC processor.

**Test Observations:**
| Program | Runtime on Reference Computer | Runtime on New Computer |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
|    1    |           50 Minutes           |        5 Minutes        |
|    2    |           75 Minutes           |        4 Minutes        |
|    3    |           60 Minutes           |        6 Minutes        |
|    4    |           30 Minutes           |        3 Minutes        |

**Calculation of SPEC Rating:**
- **Formula:** SPEC Rating = Reference Time / New Time
- **SPEC Rating for Each Program:**
  - Program 1: \( \frac{50}{5} = 10 \)
  - Program 2: \( \frac{75}{4} = 18.75 \)
  - Program 3: \( \frac{60}{6} = 10 \)
  - Program 4: \( \frac{30}{3} = 10 \)

**Overall SPEC Rating:**
- **Calculation:** Average SPEC Rating = \( \frac{10 + 18.75 + 10 + 10}{4} = 12.19 \)

**Decision:**
- The overall SPEC rating is \(12.19\), which exceeds the company's requirement of \(12\).
- Therefore, the system manager will place an order for the purchase of new computers.

**Conclusion:**
- The new computers demonstrate a favorable overall SPEC rating, indicating that they perform well on the specified benchmark tasks compared to the reference Ultra SPARCIO workstation. The system manager should proceed with the purchase order for the 1000 new computers.
